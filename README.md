## How app was made:
    - I made this app with Angular.js 1.6, with all the dependecies like angular.animate, angular.sanitize, routes etc.
    -I pulled some of the dependencies, libraries like material design, jquery etc.
    - Then i started integrating backend Rest api and all with the front end through ajax calls.
    -Also, Integrating Youtube v3 apis. 
    -Then, I thought about front end design and made that.

### Future Scope
